# Subtask 1
## Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
Hi! 
My name is **Egor**.I decided to take this course after it was recommended to me by a friend.
>And let it sound strange, but honestly ðŸ˜…

But if you look at the reasons why I decided to take part in the challenge, then this:

1. [x] decide what you like more manual testing or automated
2. [ ] learn more about automated testing and get the first experience for my portfolio
3. [ ] continue to have an English vocabulary on the topic of testing
4. [ ] find friends of interest
5. [ ] the last but not the least - enter IT and get a chance for a new life

I hope after the end of the challenge I will fill in all the task fields with a cross and get, if not a place in an internship, but definitely an important experience.

And in the end I want to say thank you for this opportunity to go from a lawyer to QA.
